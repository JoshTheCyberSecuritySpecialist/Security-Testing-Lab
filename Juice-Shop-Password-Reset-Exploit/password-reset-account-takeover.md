# Password Reset Account Takeover

## Objective
Test the password reset functionality to identify weaknesses that could allow account takeover.

## Steps
1. Navigate to the password reset page on OWASP Juice Shop.
2. Capture the password reset request using Burp Suite.
3. Modify the email parameter to target an admin user (`admin@juice-sh.op`).
4. Forward the request and observe the response.

## Impact
Unauthorized users may trigger a password reset for another user's account, potentially gaining control over the account.

## Recommendations
- Require proper verification before processing password resets.
- Implement CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks.
- Do not indicate whether an email address exists in the system.
